    "- The strategy is slow to react: it often enters late and exits early, missing out on the core of an uptrend.\n",

    "- And of course, over this period, the S&P 500 has been on a relatively strong and consistent uptrend—so staying invested without trying to time the market was actually the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I think this still serves as a good base. It highlights how important it is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate strategies on different market regimes (not just bull runs),\n",
    "- Consider out-of-sample performance seriously,\n",
    "- And maybe think about adding a few improvements—like a volatility filter, or replacing moving averages with something more responsive (RSI, MACD, or even basic price momentum).\n",
